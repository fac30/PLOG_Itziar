Assessment
** 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.**
[Learning outcomes...]

* Learn how to work with other people. I am used to doing projects on my own and at my own pace, so I had to learn how to communicate and structure the work with my teammates.
* Git. I started using Git this year, but since I was working by myself, I didn't need to learn about branches, git pull, merging, and solving conflicts.
* Asynchronus JS - Promises.
* How using JSON files can be useful when working with data.
* How to access APIs with Fetch.
* Throwing and catching errors.
* How to write in Markdown.


** 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.**
[Learning outcome...]

* During the first week, I struggled a lot with Git. Especially when working with my teammates, I had to remember all the steps and make sure there weren't any conflicts. I would like to continue improving in this area.
* I definitely want to revisit Asynchronous JS (Promises), as I struggled with the exercises and understanding how they work.
* I also want to better structure my time. I feel I take too much time to understand some terms or new subjects. While it's important to use my time well, avoiding burnout is important too. I want to find the balance between curiosity and overwhelming myself.
