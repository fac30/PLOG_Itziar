## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.

## Execute Program - SQL
I carried on learning about SQL and again learned useful things.

### Selecting expressions from tables using AS
* In SQLite, we concatenate withÂ `"a" || "b"`.
```js
exec(`CREATE TABLE cats (name TEXT)`);
exec(`INSERT INTO cats (name) VALUES ('Ms. Fluff')`);
exec(`SELECT name || ' the cat' AS name FROM cats`);

###### Result:
[{name: 'Ms. Fluff the cat'}]
```
* When we selectÂ `x BETWEEN y AND z`, theÂ `AND`Â is part ofÂ `BETWEEN`. It has nothing to do with the logicalÂ `AND`Â ofÂ `SELECT x AND y`.
`exec(SELECT name, age BETWEEN 2 AND 3 AS is_2_or_3 FROM cats);`

### Bind parameters
```js
const users = exec(`SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = ?`, [2]);
const user = users[0];
user.name;
```
### Multiple Statements
```js
exec(`
  CREATE TABLE users (name TEXT);
  INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Amir');
  SELECT * FROM users;
`);
```

## Authentication

This week I only focused solely on authentication and explored the subject as much as possible. 
For this last project, I have been taking a different approach, as I have been focusing on exploring new subjects that I want to learn and understand. (Instead of rushing and focusing on finishing the project and delivering the final product). 

So after going down an authentication rabbit hole for 2 days, trying first to implement a local strategy using passport.js, I finally decided to go with JWT.

What is a JWT?
* JWT is a compact and self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
* Since it is stateless, all the necessary information is contained within the token. This way you avoid managing any sessions.

How does it work?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f12ba54b-6b22-49e1-8b46-24612d572ab9)

The first step was creating the JWT strategy, following the documentation (which is not very good) and then doing some research to know what things to amend for our project.
```ts
const JwtStrategy = passportJwt.Strategy;
const ExtractJwt = passportJwt.ExtractJwt;

const opts: any = {};
opts.jwtFromRequest = ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken();
opts.secretOrKey = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
opts.issuer = process.env.JWT_ISSUER;
opts.audience = process.env.JWT_AUDIENCE;

export default function loadJWTStrategy() {
  passport.use(
    new JwtStrategy(opts, function (jwt_payload, done) {
      const user: User = getUserByEmail(jwt_payload.email);
      if (!user) {
        return done(null, false);
      }
      return done(null, user);
    })
  );
}
```

### Log in

For hashing and salting the password, we went with bcrypt, so we don't have to store the salt in the database.
I created a small function to compare the stored hashed_password with the one the user is using to log in.
```ts
export const comparePassword = async (
  password: string,
  hashedPassword: string
) => {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword);
};
```

Then I created a controller to check if the user trying to log in is entering the correct details, and if that's the case, generate a JWT.
```ts
export const login = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;

  try {
    const user: User = getUserByEmail(email);
    if (!user) {
      return res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid email or password" });
    }

    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.hashed_password);
    if (!isMatch) {
      return res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid email or password" });
    }

    const token = jwt.sign({ email: user.email }, JWT_SECRET, {
      expiresIn: "1h",
      issuer: process.env.JWT_ISSUER,
      audience: process.env.JWT_AUDIENCE,
    });

    res.status(200).json({ token });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Server error" });
  }
};
```
On my terminal I pasted the CURL command `curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"email": "itziar@gmail.com", "password": "123456"}' http://localhost:3000/login`, and a token has been generated:

### Sign up

 Using bcrypt again, this function will generate a hashed and salted password:
 ```ts
export const hashPassword = async (password: string) => {
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  return hashedPassword;
};
```
And then this function will insert the new registered user in our database if the email and username don't exist:
```ts
export const register = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { username, email, password } = req.body;
  try {
    const existingEmail = await getUserByEmail(email);
    if (existingEmail)
      return res.status(400).json({ message: "Email already exists" });

    const existingUsername = await getUserByUsername(username);
    if (existingUsername)
      return res.status(400).json({ message: "Usernames already exists" });

    const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(password);
    await createUser({
      username,
      email,
      hashed_password: hashedPassword,
    });

    res.status(201).json({ message: "User registered successfully" });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Error registering user" });
  }
};
```
```ts
export const createUser = (user: any) => {
  const stmt = db.prepare(
    "INSERT INTO users (username, email, hashed_password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"
  );
  stmt.run(user.username, user.email, user.hashed_password);
};
```
Time for testing 
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "testuser@example.com",
    "password": "secure123456"
  }'
```

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
### Authentication
I found the workshop quite difficult. Doing all the authentication from scratch was interesting, especially because it's always good to know how things work. 
However, for the implementation, I wanted to use a library: passport.js.

The biggest struggle was to understand the documentation, which is a bit rubbish. 
I did their tutorial, but it just tells you to copy and paste some code snippets and doesn't really explain anything. 

So I had to do some research watching tutorials and reading about it from other sources. 

### Log in
Implementing the login was the hardest part of using JWT for me. I need to do deep research to understand how to create the tokens.

## Feedback (For CF's)

> [*What went well*]

Thorough exploration of JWT authentication with clear code examples and implementation details. Good progression from basic login/register functionality to token generation. Strong understanding demonstrated through practical examples and error handling.

> [*Even better if*]

Add validation for password strength during registration and implement token refresh logic for better security. Documentation comments could be more detailed for complex functions.
