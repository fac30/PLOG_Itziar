- [Week 08](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/week08-project04-test-deploy/learning-outcomes/)

Make sure to record evidence of your processes. You can use code snippets, screenshots or any other material to support your answers.

## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
This week I wanted to make the most out of Execute Program and start learning Python, as it's a language I am interested in.
So far, I only learnt the basics, but I realised it's much cleaner and prettier than JS. 

## React
Since I have been ill, I haven't done as much as I would have liked. However, I did work on building an image carousel.

* UseEffect & UseState to fetch the images from our database.
```ts
useEffect(() => {
    const fetchProductImages = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(
          `http://18.171.123.115:3000/product-images`
        );
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error("Failed to fetch product images");
        }
        const data = await response.json();
        const slideArr = data.map((i: any) => i.image_url);

        setProductImages(slideArr);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(
          error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Image not available"
        );
      }
    };

    fetchProductImages();
  }, []);
```
* UseState to create the functions to go from one image to another.
```ts
const previousSlide = () => {
    if (current === 0) {
      setCurrent(productImages.length - 1);
    } else {
      setCurrent(current - 1);
    }
  };

  const nextSlide = () => {
    if (current === productImages.length - 1) {
      setCurrent(0);
    } else {
      setCurrent(current + 1);
    }
  };
```
* And the actual carousel component
```ts
return (
    <div className="carousel-images overflow-hidden relative">
      <div
        className={"flex transition ease-out duration-400"}
        style={{
          transform: `translateX(-${current * 100}%)`,
        }}
      >
        {productImages.map((imgSrc) => {
          return <img key={imgSrc} src={imgSrc} />;
        })}
      </div>

      <div className="absolute top-0 h-full w-full px-3 flex justify-between items-center text-white text-3xl">
        <button onClick={previousSlide}>
          <IoArrowBackCircle />
        </button>
        <button onClick={nextSlide}>
          <IoArrowForwardCircle />
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
```

## Debugging üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I think my biggest contribution to the team has been doing some ‚ú®debugging‚ú®.
Every week I have helped my team find bugs and typos in the code and this one was no different.

* Dani was struggling because she couldn't make the artist page actually show the content of the artists.
In the App.tsx was using the following Router
```ts
<Route path="/artist/:id" element={<ArtistPage />} />
```
but then in the Artist page was using
```ts
artistId` instead of just `id`: `const { artistId } = useParams<{ artistId: string }>();
```
Since she used artistId throught the rest of the function and code, the solucion was:
```ts
const { id: artistId } = useParams<{ id: string }>();
```

* Getting the correct IP address and fixing typos:
`const response = await fetch(`http://8.171.123.115/:3000/product-images`);` ‚ùå
`const response = await fetch(`http://18.171.123.115/:3000/product-images`);` ‚ùå
`const response = await fetch(`http://18.171.123.115:3000/product-images`);` ‚úÖ

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
## Deployment
Maybe it's a sign from the universe, but in both weeks that we have done deployment I missed a couple of days being ill. And both times I had Levi on the team working on it. 
So I completely neglected that part of the learning. That's why after the BootCamp I will carry on learning this on my own. 

## Python
Although this is not part of the BootCamp, I want to keep learning the language. I think it's easier once you know JavaScript, so I hope it doesn't take much time.

## Saying good-bye ü•≤
The biggest struggle this week has been accepting it's my last week in this BootCamp. The fact that I was ill and had to miss two days didn't help whatsoever.
I am happy I had the opportunity to learn with this amazing cohort, but I will miss going to space4 every day and working with them üíò
